# minis

'minis' is a software for electrophysiological data analysis.
It allows you to:\
(1) detect and analyse spontaneous postsynaptic potetnials/currents in whole-cell patch clamp recordings (Dervinis and Major, 2022);\
(2) estimate quantal size in the central synapse.

Download the trial version of the software here: https://github.com/dervinism/minis/releases  \
To install the trial version on your PC, please follow the installer instructions. As part of the installation process, yuu will have to install Matlab Runtime.

It is a proprietary software that costs $300 per user copy. If you would like to get a copy, please email Martynas Dervinis (martynas.dervinis@gmail.com). You will also need to have the serial number of your hard-drive (Windows/macOS) or your BIOS serial number (Linux). 'minis' has been fully written in Matlab (Mathworks) and is distributed as an application programming interface in the form of a packaged Matlab app or a Python (Python Software Foundation) package or as a compiled standalone desktop application with a graphical user interface.

Software documentation will be expanded in the coming days.
